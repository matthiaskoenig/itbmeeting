Dear colleagues,

Good news, everyone! There will be an ITB meeting tomorrow

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Speaker - Benjamin Maier
Title - Flockworks: A class of dynamic network models for face-to-face interactions
Location -  ITB-Inv43
Time - 2pm

Studying the dynamics of face-to-face interaction networks is essential for a better understanding of contact mediated processes, contagion processes, and disease spreading. Recent findings using novel face-to-face measurements techniques with high temporal resolution indicate that on short time scales networks exhibit complex structures characterized by disconnected groups with high internal connectivity and typical size; effects that are masked by long time averages. We introduce a single parameter, minimal dynamic network model that naturally yields group formation, analyze its properties, and discuss how contagion phenomena are expected to behave on these types of temporal networks.

If it is your turn at the ITB meeting, please prepare a short talk (15 min + 5 min discussion) that is related to your research (your own project or a very interesting finding of other groups). Please make sure that the video-projector and laptop are in place at 14:00. If you are scheduled for House 4 - the projector is already installed in the seminar room. If you are unable to give the talk at the date indicated, please find a replacement.

Titles for the talks should be sent until Sunday to me: konigmatt@googlemail.com

Thank you for your effort to keep ITB a vital and exciting meeting point for theoretical and experimental biologists!
