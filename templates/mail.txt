Dear colleagues,

Good news, everyone! There will be an ITB meeting tomorrow.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Speaker: Klamser, Pascal
Title: Collective Performance in Presence of a Predator: An inhomogeneous, local field.
Group: Collective Information Processing
Location: ITB-House4
Time: 14.00

Abstract:
From physical systems which undergo a contineous phase transition it is known that the susceptibility, the sensitivity of the system to external perturbations, diverges. Thus the assumption seems plausible that a predator which can be phrased as an inhomogeneous local field or perturbation has a harder job at coming close to agents of a collective if the collective, e.g. a swarm of fishes, is at the transition from an ordered to an unorderd phase. Extensive numerical simulations show that the phase transition does affect the performance, however; rather in an unexpected way."

See you all tomorrow.

Best
Matthias

If it is your turn at the ITB meeting, please prepare a short talk (15 min + 5 min discussion) that is related to your research (your own project or a very interesting finding of other groups). Please make sure that the video-projector and laptop are in place at 14:00. If you are scheduled for House 4 - the projector is already installed in the seminar room. If you are unable to give the talk at the date indicated, please find a replacement.

Titles for the talks should be sent until Sunday to me: konigmatt@googlemail.com

Thank you for your effort to keep ITB a vital and exciting meeting point for theoretical and experimental biologists!
