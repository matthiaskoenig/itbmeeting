Dear colleagues,

Good news, everyone! There will be an ITB meeting tomorrow.
We will have the obligatory security instructions (Belehrung zur Sicherheit),
afterwards I will give a short talk about t-SNE.

Title: The lipid divide between the membranes of the three domains of life
Speaker: Sojo, Víctor
Group: Evolutionary Biology
Location: ITB-House4
Time: 14.00

Life is by definition cellular, as delineated by membranes. Membranes are the boundary between the inside (the cell) and the outside (the environment, i.e. not the cell).
It is now clear that all known living forms on Earth are related to one another, sharing a common origin and early evolution. It would therefore be reasonable to expect organisms from all three domains of life—archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes—to share the very thing that makes a cell a cell: membranes. Yet that is not the case. Archaea and bacteria typically have utterly different membrane lipids, and eukaryotes, which seem to descend from an archaeal ancestor, actually have bacterial membrane lipids.
I will present some results from modelling and theory through which I have attempted to elucidate the puzzle of this "lipid divide", and what this may tell us about the early evolution of life and the intricate branching of the tree of life.

Keywords: lipid divide, divergence, three domains, tree of life, membranes, eukaryogenesis

See you all tomorrow.

If it is your turn at the ITB meeting, please prepare a short talk (15 min + 5 min discussion) that is related to your research (your own project or a very interesting finding of other groups). Please make sure that the video-projector and laptop are in place at 14:00. If you are scheduled for House 4 - the projector is already installed in the seminar room. If you are unable to give the talk at the date indicated, please find a replacement.

Titles for the talks should be sent until Sunday to me: konigmatt@googlemail.com

Thank you for your effort to keep ITB a vital and exciting meeting point for theoretical and experimental biologists!
