Dear colleagues,

Good news, everyone! There will be an ITB meeting tomorrow.

Title: "How can we understand the transmission and evolution of malaria? Insights from an in-silico individual-based model"
Speaker: Carrillo-Bustamante, Paola
Group: Vector Biology, MPI
Location: ITB-House 4
Time: 14.00
Web: https://www.mpiib-berlin.mpg.de/research/vector_biology

Abstract:
Vector-borne diseases are caused by pathogens transmitted among hosts by intermediate species, primarily arthropods such as mosquitoes. Extensive mathematical approaches have been developed to study the transmission dynamics of such diseases, yet the majority of these classical models focuses on the burden caused in the mammalian host, paying little attention to the physiology of the vector itself. However, in the case of malaria, several physiological properties of the vector, such as its immune system, development, and reproduction play a pivotal role in shaping the parasiteâ€™s virulence in the human host. Therefore, it is crucial to study the role of the vector in regulating the development, transmission, and evolution of the pathogen.
In this work, we develop an individual-based simulation framework that incorporates key aspects of the vector physiology and predicts infection and transmission dynamics within a human population. Our simulation results show how the heterogeneity in the mosquito population shape the transmission of the parasite. Thus, this novel approach will provide us with new concepts for unravelling the fascinating vector-host-pathogen interaction, and ultimately, inform novel interventions strategies in the fight against vector-borne diseases.

See you all tomorrow.

If it is your turn at the ITB meeting, please prepare a short talk (15 min + 5 min discussion) that is related to your research (your own project or a very interesting finding of other groups). Please make sure that the video-projector and laptop are in place at 14:00. If you are scheduled for House 4 - the projector is already installed in the seminar room. If you are unable to give the talk at the date indicated, please find a replacement.

Titles for the talks should be sent until Sunday to me: konigmatt@googlemail.com

Thank you for your effort to keep ITB a vital and exciting meeting point for theoretical and experimental biologists!
