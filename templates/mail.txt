If it is your turn at the ITB meeting, please prepare a short talk (15 min + 5 min discussion) that is related to your research (your own project or a very interesting finding of other groups). Please make sure that the video-projector and laptop are in place at 14:00. If you are scheduled for House 4 - the projector is already installed in the seminar room. If you are unable to give the talk at the date indicated, please find a replacement.

Titles for the talks should be sent until Sunday to me: konigmatt@googlemail.com

Thank you for your effort to keep ITB a vital and exciting meeting point for theoretical and experimental biologists!
