Dear colleagues,

Good news, everyone! There will be an ITB meeting tomorrow.

Title: "Robust network inference using response logic"
Speaker: Gross, Torsten
Group: Systems Biology of Molecular Networks
Location: ITB-Inv110
Time: 14.00
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract:
In this talk I will present my newly developed method to infer the directed
network structures from perturbation data. Given the myriad of already
existing methods itâ€™s fair to ask why I would want to add to the
scientific noise. But exactly this fact, that we can no longer evaluate the
quality of the network predictions, because they vastly differ depending on
the chosen method, motivated me to develop something new. My goal was to
find a maximally simple method, that is based on assumptions that should
generally hold. As such a type of sanity check on the data, I propose a
simple hypothesis, called response logic, that states that a node, which
responds to a certain perturbation will propagate the signal to its
downstream nodes and so forth. Given that in an experiment I can (at least
partially) observe which nodes respond to which perturbations, I then strive
to determine the networks that most closely reproduce these observations when
conforming to the response logic. An advantage of this approach is that the
inferred network can intuitively be traced back to the data. Therefore the
 logic approach is no black box but rather allows to reason about how network
 structure and observed response data imply each other.

While such a logic is reasonably simple, it nevertheless entails some
substantial technical problems. Due to the intractable vastness of the search
space (all possible directed networks of a given size), identifying the
conforming network structures amounts to finding a needle in a haystack.
Presenting the way I solved this computational challenge will give me the
chance to provide you with a glimpse into declarative programming
(specifically logic programming) and what it can do for you.

Despite (or rather because) of its simplicity, the response logic approach
outperforms existing methods on standard benchmarks. I will wrap up by
showing how we applied the method to RPPA data from a colorectal
adenocarcinoma cell line, where it allowed us to derive network
hypotheses that explain the distinct sensitivities of PI3K mutants
towards various targeted drugs.

If it is your turn at the ITB meeting, please prepare a short talk (15 min + 5 min discussion) that is related to your research (your own project or a very interesting finding of other groups). Please make sure that the video-projector and laptop are in place at 14:00. If you are scheduled for House 4 - the projector is already installed in the seminar room. If you are unable to give the talk at the date indicated, please find a replacement.

Titles for the talks should be sent until Sunday to me: konigmatt@googlemail.com

Thank you for your effort to keep ITB a vital and exciting meeting point for theoretical and experimental biologists!
