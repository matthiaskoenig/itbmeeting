Dear colleaques,

Good news, everyone! There will be an ITB meeting tomorrow

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Speaker - Bordyugov Grischa - Molecular and Cellular Evolution, ITB-Inv43
Title - Programming with closures for fun and profit
Location - Seminar Room - Inv 43
Time - 2pm

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Additional news! 

From this week on I will be responsible for the organisation of the 
weekly ITB seminar. So please send your talk title from now on
to `konigmatt@googlemail.com`.

Could everybody check if they are on the list of speakers below,
and if not send a short note so they can be added. 
If you notice someone on the list who left the ITB for long 
please let me know.

It would be nice to make the talks available on our new ITB homepage
https://itb.biologie.hu-berlin.de/wiki/start
So please send a PDF after the talk to me (without any confidential 
information) so I can publish the PDF

All other rules for the seminar remain unchanged and can be 
found below.

The best
Matthias

If it is your turn at the ITB meeting, please prepare a short talk (15 min + 5 min discussion) that is related to your research (your own project or a very interesting finding of other groups). Please make sure that the video-projector and laptop are in place at 14:00. If you are scheduled for House 4 - the projector is already installed in the seminar room. If you are unable to give the talk at the date indicated, please find a replacement. Titles for the talks should be sent until sunday to me: konigmatt@googlemail.com

Thank you for your effort to keep ITB a vital and exciting meeting point for theoretical and experimental biologists!
